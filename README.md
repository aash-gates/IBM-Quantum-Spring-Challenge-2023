# IBM Quantum Challenge Repository

This repository contains my solutions for the IBM Quantum Challenge. The challenge was held from May 17th to May 24th, providing a unique experience to explore the world of quantum computing.

## Resources

During the challenge, I made use of the following resources:

- [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/) - A comprehensive guide to learn about quantum computing using Qiskit.
- [IBM Quantum YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/IBMQuantum) - A collection of informative videos on quantum computing concepts and applications.
- Discord Mentors - I received valuable hints and guidance from the dedicated mentors available on Discord.

## Challenge Details

- Start Date: May 17th
- End Date: May 24th, 5pm ET

## Contents

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the challenge labs. Each lab is organized into separate directories, with detailed explanations and code implementations.

Feel free to explore the code and gain insights into quantum computing techniques and problem-solving approaches.

## Usage

To run the code and explore the solutions, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- Install Qiskit: [Qiskit Installation Guide](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html)
- Set up a quantum computing environment: [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/)

Once you have set up the necessary environment, follow the instructions provided within each lab directory to execute the code.
